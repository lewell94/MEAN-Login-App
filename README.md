To run this locally, simply download and unzip the zip folder. Then open up your command line, navigate to the folder you unzipped in and start the server using the command node server.js. 

```
$ cd documents/mean-login-app-master
$ node server.js
```
For this to work you will need to download <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Mongo</a>, enter the Mongo shell with ```mongo``` and use the correct database with ```use mean``` (only when in development environment). You will also need <a href="http://nodejs.org/#download">Node</a>. This should also install the Node Package Manager (npm) which we use to manage Node packages. You will need Jade installed on your machine, so run ```npm install jade --global```.

Once you have done that, just navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
